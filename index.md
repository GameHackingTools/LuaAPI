## Welcome to wToolkit64 LuaAPI
The aim on the github page is to give you an easy to understand documentation of our extended LuaAPI. This API is bolted onto the ingame lua and all the functions can be called in the usual way.

If there is a function you would like adding please submit a Feature Request [on our community forum](https://gamehacking.tools/community/forum/9-requests/)
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/GameHackingTools/LuaAPI/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GameHackingTools/LuaAPI/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
