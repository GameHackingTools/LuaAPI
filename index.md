The aim on the github page is to give you an easy to understand documentation of our extended LuaAPI. This API is bolted onto the ingame lua and all the functions can be called in the usual way.

If there is a function you would like adding please submit a Feature Request [on our community forum](https://gamehacking.tools/community/forum/9-requests/)
